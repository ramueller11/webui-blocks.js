# webui-blocks.js
Yet another vanilla Javascript framework written by a n00b. 
The aim of this project is to build modern paradigm user controls:
  * that are easy to implement
  * intuitive to wire up
  * snappy in the browser
  
Secondary aims:
  * learn Javascript 
  * have some laughs

This project began as a crash course to Javascript for the ramueller11. 
The project is inspired by the bootstrap.js but also the eloquence of Microsoft Visual Basic event based programming.

The former is simply beautiful, the latter has an great abstraction of view and model which is required to connect
program blocks together.
